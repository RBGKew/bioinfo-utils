# Remote Access

To access KewHPC remotely you'll need to connect to one of two VPN services. They both use the Global Protect client and use your Kew username and password.


## For Kew Staff on Kew machines

This is the standard Kew VPN, it will also give access to shared drives and other services located at Kew.

* [kgpvpn.kew.org](https://kgpvpn.kew.org)

For access contact [IT services](mailto:support@kew.org)

## For Anyone on non-Kew machines

This VPN only grants access to KewHPC. If you have access to KewHPC at Kew you have access to this VPN too.

There is also a VPN to the Wakehurst Site, to use it replace `kgpvpn.kew.org` with `wgpvpn.kew.org`


## Setting up collaborators to work on KewHPC

If a collaborator requires access to KewHPC to run analysis an account can be created for the DMZ VPN by sending the following information to support@kew.org and m.clarke@kew.org .

* Name and email of collaborator
* Name and email of sponsor (a permanent Kew staff Member, ideally a line manager)
* Account expiry date (default 6 months from account creation)
* Authorisation from Paul Kersey

The account will expire automatically or if the sponsor leaves Kew. The account can be extended by the sponsor, with authorisation from Paul Kersey.
