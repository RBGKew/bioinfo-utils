# Kew SFTP service 

There are two servaces provided by the kew SFTP:

- Public access to Kew data sets and resources

- Private sharing of data between Kew and our colaborators

## Public Kew SFTP

This can be accessed from a browser at:

	sftp.kew.org

or via a sftp client such as FileZilla or sftp on the command line:

	host: sftp.kew.org
	user: anonymous
	pass: 
    port: 22

### Contributing to the public SFTP

If you'd like to host data on the public please contact [Eduardo Toledo](e.toledo@kew.org), [Matthew Clarke](m.clarke@kew.org) or  [Reinis Rozkalns](r.rozkalns@kew.org)

The setup is very similar to the one described below for the Private SFTP.

## Private SFTP

This service allows Kew staff to send and recieve data as well as private sharing of colaborateive documents

In order to set up the SFTP accounts contact one (or all) of [Eduardo Toledo](e.toledo@kew.org), [Matthew Clarke](m.clarke@kew.org) or  [Reinis Rozkalns](r.rozkalns@kew.org).

They will request a project name, the names of all people to be added, and a public key generated by each user (see below)

A username will be assigned and given access to the sftp using the public key provided
